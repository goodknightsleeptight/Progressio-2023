<li>The main way to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to: <b>Keep fossil fuels in the ground.</b> <br>
    <b>Reasoning: </b> Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas and the more that are extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get.

<li>Secondly, <b>invest in renewable energy.</b><br>
    <b>Reasoning: </b>Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.
    
    
</li>


<br>
<br>


<li>Thirdly, <b>Switch to sustainable transport.</b><br>
    <b>Reasoning: </b>Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.


</li>

<br>
<br>

<li>Fourthly, <b>Restore nature to absorb more carbon.</b><br>
    <b>Reasoning: </b> The natural world is very good at cleaning up our emissions, but we need to look after it. Planting trees in the right places or giving land back to nature through ‘rewilding’ schemes is a good place to start. This is because photosynthesising plants draw down carbon dioxide as they grow, locking it away in soils.\
    <br>
    <b>Protect the oceans.</b> Oceans also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to keep our climate stable.
