    <h2>We need to take immediate action by harnessing the power of our resources and technology. 
        Immediate action is necessary as the longer we wait, the more difficult it gets to reverse our harmful effects on the planet.

<p>So how can Youths help stop climate change? Some youths are not rich to sponsor various environmental programs or projects. Some are not influential people who could invite many people. Some are just ordinary students. But keep in mind that all of these notions are not required in order to help fight climate change. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Youths can help stop climate change in their own simple yet purposeful ways.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Such as: joining environmental organizations or groups
    </li>
<br>
    <li>Participating in various governmental, non-governmental, school or community programs and projects against climate change</li>
<br>
    <li>Joining clean-up drives at school or in community; participating in tree planting and go-green activities; garbage picking and recycling initiatives; getting involved in environmental protests and campaigns</li>
<br>
    <li>Using social media like facebook, twitter or instagram in promoting climate change and environmental awareness to the public</li>
  <br>  
    <li>Encouraging our friends, schoolmates and our family to do what we are doing.
    </li>
<br>
<br>
</ul>
